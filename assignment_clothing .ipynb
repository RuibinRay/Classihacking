Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve.

    "Visual Inspection of the Profit Curve\n",
    "The `make_profit` function plots the curve for the profit at different thresholds (percentage of samples predicted to be positive).\n",
    "Here's how sample split thresholds are given between training and testing set.\n",
    "-Look for sections of the curve that are above the baseline profit line (i.e., the line at dsteval, which represents the profit when sending the catalog to none or to everyone).\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying Profitable Thresholds\n",
    "The thresholds of profit are points at which the plotted profit curve rises above the base.\n",
    "This is something you could actually point out in the graph: where the profit curve is above the dsteval line, this would be showing the thresholds of the population from which you would be reaping more profits due to the implementation of the classifier than baseline strategies of not sending or sending to everyone.\n",
    "Annotation: \"The cats have returned home\n",
    "The plot is just littered with things like \"DSTE\" (profit for doing nothing), \"STE\" (profit for sending to everyone), and so on.\n",
    "Annotated threshold labels over the curve make it easier to locate exactly the thresholds that give positive profit.\n",
    "In this respect,\n",
    "He should read the graph to determine from the plot the set of decision thresholds that minimize loss or maximize profit if the cost ratio and prior odds are known. The lowest and highest bounds define the range of decision thresholds on which the profit curve lies above the baseline. So, in practical application, to maximize the profit, one will choose the set of decision thresholds within this range.\n",
    "For instance, a curve showing the profits are above a positive threshold between values 0.1 to 0.6; then making your decision threshold within this range will be the optimal threshold for making the highest profitability.\n",
    "\"It\n",
    "The profit curve will directly show the range of thresholds that produce profit. In other words, you may find the operational thresholds that maximize the financial outcomes for the marketing campaign by investigating the position where it goes above the baseline profit (dsteval). This approach opens up scope for a strategic way of deciding the choice of thresholds based on economic consideration rather than purely statistical metrics, which are important in business applications like direct marketing.\n"
